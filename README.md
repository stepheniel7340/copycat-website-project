Reflection: This project made me really understand CSS and HTML better. In class, I learned about CSS and HTML during the jigsaw presentations, but I didn't reallt understand it until I tried it out for myself in this project. A website could look simple, but have long complicated codes to it. While coding, I realized how important margin and padding is to make everything align and centered.
